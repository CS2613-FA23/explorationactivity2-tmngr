# Library selection

Express.js is a back end webapp framework used for web and mobile applications that creates API's. 

# Starting to use pygame

As usual when we start to work with a new library, we need to install the packages required first:

```
npm install express
```

Since coding is something test base where you have to run after each change and working with webapp framework makes this progress a little harder than it should be. Hence, even if it is not required I suggest installing "nodemon" along side of Express:

```
npm install -g nodemon
```
