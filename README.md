# Which package/library does the sample program demonstrate?
While I was thinking about working on the same library (or to improve) my first exploration activity. I have decided to work on Express.js for JavaScript.

# How does someone run your program?

This program works with express.js to work as webapp. Since express.js is design to work as webapp, all we have to do to install the package probably and run the code.

To install the packgace, we follow the same method as we always do on JS which will be given in the overview page as well:

```
npm install express
```
